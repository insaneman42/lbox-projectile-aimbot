## This fork does **NOT** use LNXLib or ImMenu
it uses my lib, but it gets downloaded on the script so you dont need to download anything extra :3

---

Only for ***projectiles***

---

Most settings of the aimbot are configured on lbox menu (ignore cloaked, bonked, aim fov, aim key, aim method, etc)

If Lmaobox's aimbot is enabled, this script ***WILL*** disable it when using a projectile weapon :) (we dont need 2 aimbots running at the same time, do we?)

### Features
- Options on the lbox menu that affect the script:
   - aim key
   - aim fov
   - auto shoot
   - ignore cloaked
   - ignore bonked
   - ignore taunting
   - ignore disguised
   - ignore deadringer
   - ignore steam friends
   - aim method (projectiles) -> projectile weapon aim method (silent, psilent, plain)
   - projectile aimbot -> Draw makes the predicted path be visible

### Features soon to be added:
- Aim at stickies (scorch shot)
- NPCs like Merasmus, that flying eyeball thing, tank, etc
- more stuff that i forgor to remember ☠️
