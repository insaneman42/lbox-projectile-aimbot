## This fork does **NOT** use LNXLib or ImMenu

---

This supports both ***projectile*** and ***hitscan***, disable lbox's aimbot if you want to use it.

---

Most settings of the aimbot are configured on lbox menu (ignore cloaked, bonked, aim fov, aim key, aim method, etc)

If Lmaobox's aimbot is enabled, this script ***WILL*** not run until you disable it :) (we dont need 2 aimbots running at the same time, do we?)

### Features
- Options on the lbox menu that affect the script:
   - aim key
   - aim fov
   - auto shoot
   - ignore cloaked
   - ignore bonked
   - ignore taunting
   - ignore disguised
   - ignore deadringer
   - ignore steam friends
   - aim method -> hitscan weapon aim method (silent, plain)
   - aim method (projectiles) -> projectile weapon aim method (silent, psilent, plain)
   - projectile aimbot -> Aim+Draw makes the predicted path be visible

### Features soon to be added:
- Aim at sentries, dispensers, teleporters and stickies
- NPCs like Merasmus, that flying eyeball thing, tank, etc
- more stuff that i forgor to remember ☠️
